    <h1>Hey 👋</h1>

    <p>
      I’ve been wanting to say this for a long time.<br><br>
      You’re not just my best friend to me.
      Somewhere along the way, you became the person I care about the most.
      I feel comfortable with you, I trust you, and I genuinely like the person I am when I’m around you.
      <br><br>
      I don’t want to ruin what we have, but I also don’t want to hide how I feel anymore.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      So… would you like to be more than just friends?
    </p>

    <button onclick="showMessage()">Take your time</button>
  </div>

  <script>
    function showMessage() {
      alert("No pressure. Take your time ❤️");
    }
